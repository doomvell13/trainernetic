# Trainernetic

#### I made this app for personal trainers/yoga instructors to manage their clients profile to improve their effectively in their work flow.

## Main Technologies Used: 
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, passport-google-oauth20 , Method override, Mongoose, Mongo DB

## Approach Taken 
I intend to use an existing template for better UI interface and better use of the components to display data on the app.


## Challenges Faced: 
Lack of time. 

Lack of decent documentation of passport.js. 

Working with templates and slicing them into EJS can be painful. There's 100s lines of code with 90% of the code i won't be using. But I am now confident to slice any 10000 line code into EJS. I've also learnt to read code in chunks of opening and closing tags.


## Resources which was helpful for me

## Unresolved Problems:
I wanted to implement passport js local strategy instead of having just one authentication. I realise it's not as simple as i thought it was. I should have spent the time inplementing another model and/or populated some meaning data(number of clients, number of active clients,etc) to display on the dashboard.

## Things to improve on
Populate some simple data to display on dashboard.
Implement one more model to display session bookings to display on clients profile page.
